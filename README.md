Designed and implemented a city trip planning API to efficiently power route and search services for tourism applications.
Developed backend functionality in DSSL2 to support three core queries: listing all points-of-interest (POI) by category, planning shortest routes from any start to a destination, and finding the N closest POIs of a given type.
Engineered the API using optimized data structures (hash tables, weighted undirected graphs, priority queues) and advanced algorithms (custom Dijkstra with binary heap priority queues).
Achieved substantial improvements in runtime and scalability compared to standard Dijkstraâ€”by leveraging binary heap structures and careful graph mapping
Reduced time complexity of shortest path queries and POI lookups, resulting in a more responsive trip planning experience for users navigating complex city maps.
